A project for a blog-site.

## Description

The aim for this project was to create a responsive website for a blog that i would decide, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and also using WordPress as a headless CMS. Some mandatory elements was a carousel on the home-page showing the latest posts, a "view more" function on the blogpost page, a blog specific page using a querystring parameter that will also change the title of the page, creating an image-modal so that when images are clicked, a modal appears with a larger image and a contact form with validation. The site needed to be responsive, and look good on all screen-sizes. 

Stages of development:

- Making a plan in Trello
- Creating a prototype in Adobe XD
- installing WordPress on my web host and add the blogs on the admin panel
- Building the website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- installed Hotjar on the website
- User testing
- Made changes where i saw fit after the user testing
